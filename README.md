# quotes

## Feature Tasks

- Use the file recentquotes.json to show random popular book quotes. Your program should use GSON to parse the .json file. The app needs no functionality other than showing the quote and the author when it is run. The app should choose one quote each time it is run.

## Set-up

- Add this line to your build.gradle: `implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.8'`
- Refresh in IntelliJ
  - See the 'Gradle' Tab to the right of your IntelliJ window
  - Click the refresh button on the top left
